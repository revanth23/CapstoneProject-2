This is our Capstone Project of Motion detection.

Motion detection is the ability to recognize the presence of movements. Our Project is a motion detector which captures the movements with the red square.
So our idea is to take a picture from webcam every period of time. Even small movements can be captured and notified. Doesnâ€™t necessarily require constant and continuous surveillance. A motion can be viewed by a red colour Square box difference in frame.

The Webcam motion detector surveillance  system  is a home/office based security system which can be of great where security is a matter of concern. Motion detection is the most important feature in digital video surveillance system. It gives the camera the capability to capture when needed rather than capture all the time and this leads to huge reduction in storage space. Therefore, it is necessary for the surveillance techniques to also improve with the changing world.
